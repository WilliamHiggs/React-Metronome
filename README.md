# React-Metronome :musical_score:

### Things I've added so far:
- AudioContextTimers to try and beat throttling
- Time Signatures for expanding uses
- Fieldset just to improve layout a bit
### Things to add:
- No reliance on setInterval, it's plain bad for accurate timing
- WebAudioApi context for better timings
- A choice of different clicks
- better stylings
- better README
